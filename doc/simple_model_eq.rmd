\section{Simple Crop-switching Model}

\subsection{Model Setup}

We start with a simple model of output by farm $i$ in year $t$ as $y_{it} = f(x_{it}, z_{it})$ where $z_{it}$ are temperatures on the farm and $x_{it}$ are decisions made by the farm that maximize profits. Farmers make decisions based on their expectations about temperatures that are implicit in output. Therefore, farm-level decisions are a function of temperatures where our simple model transforms to $y_{it} = f(x_{it}(z_{it}), z_{it})$. We therefore model a quadratic production function with respect to temperature as,

$$
y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 z_{it} + \beta_2 z_{it}^2
$$

Equation 1 defines aggregate output for all crops on the farm, or the sum of individual crop output,

\begin{equation}
y_{it} =\sum_{c=1}^C y_{cit} =  \beta_0 + \beta_1 z_{it} + \beta_2 z_{it}^2
\end{equation}

In this simple model, output $y_{it}$ is measured as production per acre where $q_{it}$ is production and $a_{it}$ is harvested acres. 

Each year, farmers decide how many total acres to cultivate and how much of each crop to plant. A farmer's decision is not random and relies on knowledge from previous seasons. Because output is a function of temperature, their decision is assumed to be based on expections about temperature.  If, for example, temperatures are expected to increase, then the farmer will rely on their knowledge of each crops sensitivity to temperature and plant occordingly. This is known as crop switching.

To model how output changes based on crop-switching practices, we explicitly model the decision variable, $x_{it}$. In year $t$, farmer $i$ faces the decision of how much to plant of each crop $c$, which is composed of five varieties: corn, cotton, hay, wheat, and soybean. Their decision is defined by the proportion of total acres $a_{cit}$ they designate for each crop, which is an element of $x_{cit} \in [0,1]$.  For example, a farmer could decide to plant 20\% of total acres with each crop, in which case $x_{cit}$ = 0.2. Given this specification, the sum of $x_{cit}$ is equal to one. 

Farmers respond to year-to-year changes in temperature by making short-run adjustments to their decisions. However, changes observed over longer periods would indicate permanent long-run shifts in their decision. We define these permanant shifts as adaptation to climate change.

In the long-run, $d$ years measure the expectations of farmers by comparing the average temperatures over specific intervals (e.g. 30-year intervals average two intervals: 1950-1980 \& 1980-2010). Generally we define these temperature intervals as $\overline{z_{id}}$. If farmers are responding to long-run expectations, then the yearly acreage decision $x_{cdt} = f(\overline{z}_{id}$). Just as with production, we assume $x_{cdt}$ follows a quadratic process given by,

$$
x_{cdt} =   \beta_0 + \beta_1 \overline{z}_{id} + \beta_2 \overline{z}_{id}^2
$$

It is important to consider that acres are finite for any farmer $i$; although, acres can change for each year $t$ or interval $d$. As a result, changes in the proportion of individual crops acres are correlated across crops (i.e. an increase in corn acres decreases at least one other crop acre on the farm). Therefore, each crop is modeled as one element of a system of equations  where the total cultivated acreage $a_{id}$ is defined as,

\begin{equation}
x_{id} = 
\begin{cases} x_{1id} = \beta_0^1 + \beta_{1}^1 \overline{z_{id}} + \beta_{2}^1 \overline{z_{id}}^2 \\ 
\hspace{2mm} \vdots \\
x_{5id} = \beta_0^5 + \beta_{1}^5 \overline{z_{id}} + \beta_{2}^5 \overline{z_{id}}^2
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

This system defines each farmers' acreage decisions.

The correlation between crops carries over to yearly outputs, therefore a  similar system of equations is used to model total crop output $y_{it}$, given below,

\begin{equation}
y_{it} = \sum_{c=1}^5 y_{cit} =  
\begin{cases} y_{1it} = \beta_0^1 + \beta_{1}^1 z_{it} + \beta_{2}^1 z_{it}^2 \\ 
\hspace{2mm} \vdots \\
y_{5it} = \beta_0^5 + \beta_{1}^5 z_{it} + \beta_{2}^5 z_{it}^2
\end{cases}
\end{equation}



Using equations 1,2, and 3 above, we can identify the effects of crop switching with respect to short-run and long-run expectations of temperature. First, we estimate aggregate output per acre in response to weather and climate changes in equation 1 which can capture adjustments in production practices, such as planting times, double-cropping, and rotations. These estimates are then used as a baseline to compare against crop-switching using equation 2 and 3. Next, we use crop shares from equation 2 to estimate individual crop acre changes as the climate changes over interval, $d$. We then use crop-specific output per acre in equation 3 to estimate crop output responses to weather, holding land allocation and production practices fixed. 

The estimates from equation 2 and 3 are combined to compare output per acre with crop-switching, $y_{it}^{\text{crop-switching}}$, versus aggregate crop output per acre from equation 1, $y_{it}^{\text{aggregate}}$. We average farm-level output per acre in the aggregate to make these comparisons. As a result, if crop-switching is beneficial we expect the sum of average farm-level output to be greater than the sum of aggregate output,

$$
\underbrace{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T y_{it}}_{\text{\text{Eq. 2 \& 3}}} = \overline{y}_{it}^{\text{\hspace{.5mm} Crop-switching}} >  \overline{y}_{}^{\text{\hspace{.5mm} Aggregate}} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T y_{it}}_{\text{\text{Eq.} 1}}
$$
